This assignment was completed as a Jupyter notebook and submitted as a .ipynb file.

Also, I did not import libraries directly in code in order to reduce runtime when not needed. Since most other students are probably using similar libraries, they will likely already be in your Julia registry. If the first cell of the notebook throws an error, please use 

import Pkg; import("Library") to import the missing library. 

If the error persists, I recommend restarting the kernel or deleting the Julia/Registries/General folder and trying again.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!
