# Data-Science-Spring-21
Projects related to a data science elective I took at UF. Lots of fun data science stuff done in Julia!

Each folder represents a project or group of related projects done in Julia as part of an elective.

Each folder has its own README.txt explaining how that project works and how it can be run.

PLEASE NOTE: All commands instructed in the README files must be entered on a computer that has Julia installed. They often work best in the Julia REPL. For more information on how to install Julia, visit JuliaLang.org! I highly recommend checking it out- it is very similar to Python in nature but often runs faster than expected.

If you have any questions or need help getting these files to run (it can be tricky, especially if new to Julia) feel free to contact me!
